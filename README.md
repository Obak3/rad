# within-lines
Searching through text for a substring similar to the results of grep or ripgrep, but also being able to search for another string found within a number of lines of the first search substring.

I need this for work a lot of the time, so this is more of a personal thing, but the ultimate goal would be to potentially push a feature to the ripgrep library. That being said, rust is hard.
